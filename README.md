# Amazon Sales - Cleaning, EDA, Sentiment Analysis Using Python

## Welcome to my portfolio on GitHub! In this project, I have performed a thorough analysis on the Amazon Sales dataset using Python. The dataset contains over 1000 real products listed on the Amazon marketplace from India, and my main objective was to clean and prepare the data for further analysis.

* ### To begin with, I noticed that the raw data was highly unorganized, and thus I started by implementing various data cleaning techniques such as changing data types from object to floats, filling in missing information, checking for duplicate rows, splitting long strings, and creating new columns.

* ### After cleaning and preparing the data, I moved on to exploring the dataset by finding insights and visualizing them. The observations I made during the data exploration phase included the product category, correlation between features, and product ratings.

* ### Overall, this project showcases my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization. Thank you for taking the time to review my project!
